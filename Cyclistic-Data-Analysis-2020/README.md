Cyclistic is a fictional company based on [Divvy](https://divvybikes.com) bikes.

Until now, Cyclistic's marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. The flexible pricing plans (single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships) aided in bringing in new customers. Customers are divided into two classes: casual riders (those who purchase either the single-ride or full-day passes) and Cyclistic members (who purchase annual memberships).

Although pricing flexibility helps in attracking new customers, Cyclistic's finance analyst have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The director of marketting (Lily Moreno) believes that increasing the number of annual members will be the key to future growth. Since casual riders have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs and are already aware of the annual membership program, a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into members is to be held.
