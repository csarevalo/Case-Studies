## About this Project
This case study is my capstone project for the Google Data Analatics Professional Certificated (via Coursera).

Here, I assume the role of a junior data analyst working in a marketing analyst team at Cylistic, a fictional bike-share company stationed in Chicago based on [Divvy](https://divvybikes.com) bikes. The objective is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. These insights will help the marketing team to develop new marketting strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must be compelled with data insights and professional data visualizations.

The analysis is based on the Divvy case study "'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polishedâ€™: Divvy and Data Visualization" written by Kevin Hartman ([found here]( https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study))

## Introduction

Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago, USA. In 2016, Cyclistic Launched a successful bike-share program offering bike rentals throughout the city. Since then, the program has expanded to a fleet over 5,800 bicyclesk that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Customers are divided into two classes: casual riders (those who purchase either the single-ride or full-day passes) and Cyclistic members (who purchase annual memberships). 

Until now, Cyclistic's marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. The flexible pricing plans (single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships) aided in bringing in new customers.

Although pricing flexibility helps in attracking new customers, Cyclistic's finance analyst have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The director of marketting (Lily Moreno) believes that increasing the number of annual members will be the key to future growth. Since casual riders have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs and are already aware of the annual membership program, a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into members is to be held.

### Business Task

The marketing team would like to known:
* How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
* Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
* How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Specifically, my focus will revolve around on ***how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently***.
